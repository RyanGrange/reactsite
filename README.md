# Ryan Grange's React Site

Everyone wants proof I can work in React.

So here you go.

I'm using devcontainer so you hopefully don't have to go through the pain of setting up your system with all the various packages or programs. You'll still need docker and docker-compose installed.

To start (from inside the dev container)...

* open a terminal inside the devcontainer
* cd rgreact
* npm install
* npm run dev
  * or npm run build
  * or npm run lint
  * or npm run preview
